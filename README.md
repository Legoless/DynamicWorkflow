# DynamicWorkflow

**Dynamic Workflow** is an experimental project to create a possibility to link dynamic libraries (.DLL) into a workflow. Using custom built embedded language, you have the ability to build your own workflows from chosen dynamic library repository. The application has a native Windows feel and it is built with Windows Forms API. The scripting engine is scratch-built with C# and it uses reflection capabilities of .NET framework. It supports all managed-mode assemblies from version 2.0 to 4.0. Static methods are not supported.
